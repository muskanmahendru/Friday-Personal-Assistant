Wake Word Detection: Wake-up word (WuW) detection is used to put an intelligent device in a state of alert so that it expects further spoken commands. It allows for hands-free operation of devices such as smart phones, multimedia systems in cars or home automation systems. 
Speech Recognition: Speech recognition helps us to save time by speaking instead of typing. It also gives us the power to communicate with our devices without even writing one line of code. This makes technological devices more accessible and easier to use. Speech recognition is a great example of using machine learning in real life.
Neural network: An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN): A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input voice, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the voice and be able to differentiate one from the other.

Fetching data from Wikipedia: The wikipedia.summary() function takes two arguments, the statement given by the user and how many sentences from Wikipedia is needed to be extracted is stored in a variable result. 
Searching data from web: From the web browser you can search required data by passing the user statement (command) to the open_new_tab() function. 
Capturing photo: The ec.capture() function is used to capture images from your camera. 
Predicting time: The current time is abstracted from datetime.now() function which displays the hour, minute and second and is stored in a variable name strTime
